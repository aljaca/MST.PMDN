Description: Implements the Multivariate Skew t-Parsimonious Mixture Density Network (MST-PMDN),
    a distributional deep learning regression framework based on a mixture of MST distributions.
    Provides user‐facing functions to define, train, predict, and sample from deep MST-PMDN models
    built with torch for R.
